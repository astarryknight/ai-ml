## Welcome to IEEE AI/ML!

This is the new page for the IEEE AI/ML Group! We will use this page to host all of our lessons and projects, so that you have a centralized location to find any resources you need.

## World Class Curriculum

This curriciulum was carefully crafted and based on effective curricula from universities and research institutes like Princeton, Stanford, Google, and many others.

## Real Projects, Real Results

We have worked hard to design a new **project based** curriculum. By the end of the course, you will have a wide range of real world projects that you can use as resume builders and idea starters.

## Get Started!
