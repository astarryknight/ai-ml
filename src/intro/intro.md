## Introduction

Welcome to IEEE AI/ML! This curriculum is designed to be completed asynchronously and focuses on building practical AI/ML skills through short lessons and mini activities.

To get started:
1. Follow the [Learning Path](../pathway.html).
2. Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) unless a mini explicitly recommends local setup.
3. Complete module [Checkpoints](../assessments/checkpoints.html) as you go.

First, dive into the intro lessons to align on AI/ML fundamentals and Python/NumPy workflow basics.
