## Theory
Here, you will learn the conceptual and mathematical framework that powers machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Recommended sequence:
1. Intro to Machine Learning
2. Optimization & Gradient Descent
3. Evaluation Basics
4. Feature Engineering Basics
5. Artificial Neural Networks
6. Natural Language Processing
7. Reinforcement Learning

Use the [Learning Path](../pathway.html) for async pacing.
