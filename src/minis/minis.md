## Minis
Here, you can find some short "mini" projects to work on. They span many different regimes, and can (mostly) be completed within a week or 2. Great for quick learning and useful for resume building! Look through the list below to get started.

For async progression:
1. Start with [Optimization Playground](./opt.html).
2. Complete [Spotify Music Recommendation](./spotify.html).
3. Choose one more mini from ANN, NLP, or RL.

Track your understanding with [Checkpoints](../assessments/checkpoints.html).
